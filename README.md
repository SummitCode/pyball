# `pyball`

**Unfinished** Library for grabbing baseball statistics in python

## Why `pyball`

Another python library for getting baseball statistics already exists ([pybaseball](https://github.com/jldbc/pybaseball)), however, pyball provides built in functions for getting data in the form of a JSON string for easy parsing and presentation of data, not just pandas tables in terminal.

## Requirements
- Python 3(.7)

## Install/Build From Source
```
pip install --user --upgrade setuptools

cd pyball

setup.py install
```
